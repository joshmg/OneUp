bugs:
non compatability bug
[X] fixed STRZ ugliness
[X] no end record
undefined symbol not spouting an error
[X] empty file with just .END 0
starting record is outside bounds of the source file
relocatbable: .FILL and .STRZ symbol is being qualified as an absolute
segment name length is too long :: SEGFAULT
.EQU can assign a symbol with a value larger 16 bits
.ORIG allowing a hex value that is out of the bounds of 16 bits
Branch with no CCR qualifiers doesn't spout an error
Relocatable values not being documented in object file. ex: valid_br1.s

Compiling the Wi-11 Assembler
-----------------------------

On a UNIX machine, simply running the "make" command should work.
This requires that both g++ and make are installed.

Even without make, the command:
	g++ -o wi11-asm *.cpp
run in the same directory as this file, should suffice.

Either method will create an executable called "wi11-asm".

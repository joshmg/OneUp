The arguemnts to the operation (including unecessary bits). 

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Example:}
The add instruction comes in two forms: 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item dest\_\-reg = source\_\-reg\_\-1 + source\_\-reg\_\-2 For this form, the encoding (as ordered) is as follows: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item dest\_\-reg 
\item source\_\-reg\_\-1 
\item a 0 
\item 2 unused bits 
\item source\_\-reg\_\-2 These segments are each an element of the data vector. 
\end{DoxyItemize}\end{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item dest\_\-reg = source\_\-reg + immediate\_\-value For this form, the encoding (as ordered) is as follows: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item op code 
\item dest\_\-reg 
\item source\_\-reg\_\-1 
\item a 1 
\item a 5-\/bit immediate value These segments are also each an element of the data vector. 
\end{DoxyItemize}In short, any division specified in \hyperlink{index_instructions}{Wi-\/11 Instruction Set} will be an element of the data vector.\end{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Both of the overloaded instructions (ADD and AND) can be differentiated by the number of divisions: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ADD with two registers has 5 \item ADD with a register and immediate has 4 and \item AND with two registers has 5 \item AND with a register and immediate has 4 Thus the fifth bit (either a 1 or 0) is not needed to determine the variation of the instruction (HOWEVER: the 1 or 0 is still included). \end{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyNote}

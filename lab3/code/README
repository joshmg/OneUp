Compiling the Wi-11 Assembler
-----------------------------

UNIX:
-----

If make is installed, run the "make" (or possibly "gmake") command.
This requires that g++ is installed.

Without make, the command:
	g++ -o wi11 cpp/*.cpp
  Note: Run in the same directory as this file.

Either method will create an executable called "wi11".

Windows:
--------

Supported Compiler:
	Microsoft (R) 32-bit C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 16.00.30319.01 for 80x86

At command line, run the command "cl *.cpp /owi11 /EHsc"

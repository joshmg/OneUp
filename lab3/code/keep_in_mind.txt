|Issues|
--------
.EXT with symbols defined in current file.
.ENT with symbols not defined in current file.

Absolute programs with external points.  Bug?

--------
|Design|
--------
M instead of H for Main file: .MAIN pseudo-op
   -- determines load addr
Externals:  X|ADDR|INST|
            SYMBOL
Entries:    N|SYMBOL|ADDR|
SymbolTable::Contains --> IsSymbol
			       Added: IsExternal
Same label in multiple .EXT's intentionally ignored.
   -- Essentially an ifndef.
External labels can only be used as pgoffset9's.
   -- must be relative
